1) Create a github reposistory called i.e End-to-end-Machine-Learning-Project-with-MLflow where you can make it public, add .gitignore for python and select MIT license

2) Clone the reposistory in local and open it with vs code. Also Create new conda env i.e mlflow_project and activate it.

3) Create template.py file and we are creating this template.py file because we need lots of files and folders to manage the code. So that I do not need to create files and folders manually because script will automatically creates all of them.

4)Run template.py

5) .github has .gitkeep because we will be pushing to github repo for ci-cd pipeline using github workflows.

6) commit the changes to the github using=> git add . && git commit -m "folder structure added" && git push origin main
